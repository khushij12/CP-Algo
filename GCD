Question: Among all pairs of distinct integers in [1,n], find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of integers in pair. Formally, find the maximum value of gcd(a,b), where 1≤a<b≤n. (question link - https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1370/A)
->Key Idea: Answer for any n≥2 is equal to ⌊n2⌋ .
->Solution: Let the maximum gcd be equal to g. Since the two numbers in a pair are distinct, one of them must be >g and both of them must be divisible by g. The smallest multiple of g, greater than g, is 2⋅g. Since each number in the pair must be ≤n, we must have 2⋅g≤n, or g≤⌊n2⌋. We can achieve g=⌊n2⌋, by choosing ⌊n2⌋ and 2⋅⌊n2⌋.
